# ✋🎮 AI-Powered Rock–Paper–Scissors using MediaPipe & Python

An AI-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game that allows users to play the classic game against the computer using hand gestures, powered by MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Python — all through a webcam.

This project demonstrates real-time computer vision, hand gesture recognition, and interactive game logic, enabling a touchless and engaging gaming experience.

# 🚀 Features

🎥 Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands
✊✋✌️ Accurate gesture recognition for Rock, Paper, and Scissors
⏱️ Countdown timer for fair gesture capture
🤖 AI-based opponent with random decision logic
📊 Live score tracking (Player vs AI)
⚡ FPS monitoring for real-time performance analysis
🖥️ Touchless and hardware-free interaction

# 🧠 How It Works

Finger positions are analyzed to identify gestures

Gestures are classified as Rock, Paper, or Scissors

AI generates a random move

Game logic compares player and AI moves

Results and scores are displayed in real time
